{"name":"LAGOS GIS Toolbox","tagline":"LAGOS GIS Toolbox for ArcGIS 10.1","body":"LAGOS GIS Toolbox\r\n===================\r\n\r\nArcGIS toolbox for landscape limnology.\r\n\r\nThis toolbox is for ArcGIS and was created with and for version 10.1. It will not work with any previous version of ArcGIS.\r\nIt might work for 10.2, but we are not sure yet.\r\nIt also requires Spatial Analyst for some tools and Rivex for an input (rivers with Strahler) to the Lake Order Tool.\r\n\r\nWhile some steps in our workflow at Michigan State University are conducted in a supercomputing environment (ie Taudem\r\npitremove & d8flowdir were ported to RHEL to get the data processed faster), you can do these steps on a workstation\r\neasily enough, with ESRI's tools or with Taudem toolbox or command line. Taudem tools are very helpful.\r\n\r\nThe toolbox is unsupported but feel free to direct questions to Patricia Soranno, soranno@msu.edu \r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
