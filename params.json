{"name":"LAGOS GIS Toolbox","tagline":"LAGOS GIS Toolbox for ArcGIS 10.1","body":"**LAGOS GIS Toolbox**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/soranno/LAGOS_GIS_Toolbox/blob/master/LAGOS_GIS_Toolbox/ConnectedLakes.py\r\n\r\n_An ArcGIS toolbox for limnology, watersheds and attribution._\r\n\r\nThis toolbox is for ArcGIS and was created with and for version 10.1. It won't work with any previous version of ArcGIS. It might work for 10.2, but that is currently untested. It also requires Spatial Analyst for some tools and Rivex for an input (rivers with Strahler) to the Lake Order Tool. These tools are very beta and still in development. Most were created to produce a one-time mass run of terrain analysis and lake attribution. While some steps in our workflow at Michigan State University are conducted in a supercomputing environment (ie Taudem pitremove & d8flowdir were ported to RHEL to get the data processed faster), you can do these steps on a workstation easily enough, with ESRI's tools or with Taudem toolbox or command line. Taudem tools are really helpful for those of you interested in using GIS for hydrology. You can get them at: http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5.0/downloads.html\r\n\r\nThe CSI Limnology Toolbox comes without guarantees of any kind. We just put it on Git because we like to share. The toolbox is unsupported but feel free to direct questions to me, Scott Stopyak: stopyaks@msu.edu\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
